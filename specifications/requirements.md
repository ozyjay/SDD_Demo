# Emoji Flappy (Fullscreen, Random) ‚Äî Requirements

## 1. Overview
**Project:** Emoji Flappy (PyGame + pygbag)  
**Version:** 0.2
**Date:** 2025-10-30

**Summary:**  
A web-based PyGame clone of Flappy Bird using emojis, compatible with pygbag for browser deployment. The player controls üê§ using keyboard or touch to flap upwards and avoid randomly generated emoji obstacles. Gameplay is entirely randomised ‚Äî no fixed seed or deterministic sequence. Runs in GitHub Codespaces via web browser.

## 2. Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| REQ-001 | Web-based display. | High | Game runs in browser at fixed resolution (800x600). Can be served via pygbag and accessed through forwarded port. Closing browser tab quits cleanly. |
| REQ-002 | Flap and gravity physics. | High | Space/tap applies upward velocity; gravity acts continuously; limits set by constants in `config.py`. |
| REQ-003 | Randomised obstacle generation. | High | Obstacles spawn at variable intervals, random gap size/position, with no deterministic seed. |
| REQ-004 | Collision detection. | High | Overlap between player emoji and any obstacle or screen boundary ends the run immediately. |
| REQ-005 | Score tracking. | Medium | Score increments when player passes an obstacle pair. |
| REQ-006 | Restart after game over. | Medium | After collision, a ‚ÄúPress Space to Restart‚Äù prompt appears; restarting resets state without closing the app. |
| REQ-007 | Mute toggle. | Low | Press ‚ÄúM‚Äù to toggle sounds (flap, score, crash). |
| REQ-008 | Quit shortcut. | High | Press Esc or Q to quit at any time (browser-compatible). |
| REQ-009 | Async compatibility. | High | Game loop uses async/await for pygbag compatibility. |

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Category | Measurement |
|----|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| NFR-001 | Frame rate stability. | Performance | 60 FPS target on native display. |
| NFR-002 | Input latency. | Performance | Flap visible within ‚â§75 ms. |
| NFR-003 | Browser compatibility. | Reliability | Runs in modern browsers via pygbag/WebAssembly. |
| NFR-004 | Randomisation quality. | Gameplay | Each playthrough has unique obstacle timing and gaps. |
| NFR-005 | Graceful quit. | UX | Game releases all resources and closes without errors. |

## 4. Physics Constants (see `src/config.py`)
- `G`: gravity acceleration  
- `V_FLAP`: upward impulse  
- `V_MAX_UP`, `V_MAX_DOWN`: clamp limits  
- `SCROLL_SPEED`: obstacle speed  
- `GAP_SIZE_RANGE`: min‚Äìmax tuple for random gap size  
- `SPAWN_INTERVAL_RANGE`: min‚Äìmax tuple for random spawn timing

## 5. Test Mapping
| Req | Test File | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| REQ-002 | `tests/test_physics.py` | Verify velocity updates correctly with gravity/flap over dt. |
| REQ-003 | `tests/test_random_spawns.py` | Ensure spawns vary across runs; no repeating sequences. |
| REQ-004 | `tests/test_collision.py` | Confirm collisions trigger game-over state. |
| REQ-005 | `tests/test_score.py` | Verify score increments when passing obstacles, high score tracking. |
| REQ-006 | `tests/test_restart.py` | Confirm restart resets state without closing app. |
| REQ-007 | `tests/test_mute.py` | Verify mute toggle functionality. |

## 6. Revision History
| Ver | Date | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| 0.1 | 2025-10-30 | Initial version (desktop fullscreen) |
| 0.2 | 2025-10-30 | Updated for pygbag/web browser compatibility |
| 0.3 | 2025-10-30 | Implemented REQ-005 to REQ-009 (score, restart, mute, quit, async) |
